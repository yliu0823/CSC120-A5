- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
I think the different types of associations would influence the way I code and link the classes altogether. Overall, I think it will work well when I follow the instructions.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think most works for me. I think I would advice to go over powerpoints and the onecard samples before and while coding. Looking at Java documentation is also helpful. Lastly, it would be helpful to go to TA dropin hours.
